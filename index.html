  <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
  <p><strong>ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT FORUM</strong> is an initiative that targets the poor and the less prieviledged groups or individuals in the society but have the potential and ready to change their lives and the situation currently existing. The main aim is to attain development in the community. As it is well known, there are four approaches or strategies to the challenge of development. Those approaches include: Economic Approach, Basic Needs Approach, Capabilities Approach and Human Development Approach.</p>
  <p>Economic Approach faced many challenges since despite economic growth, many people became poor and it also resulted to the development of slums and informal settlemnts. <br>
     Basic Needs Approach on the other hand focused on the basic needs of people where the government used to provide but Amartya Sen came up with the <strong>capabilities approach</strong> which extends from provision basic needs. Sen argued that humans desire to live full and productive lives. <br>
     <strong>Human Development Approach</strong> on the hand encompasses enlarging people's choices to develop to their full potential and lead a productive and fulfilling life as well as functioning members of their families and communities.
  </p>
  <p><strong>ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT FORUM</strong> is an initiative that focuses on <strong>HUMAN DEVELOPMENT APPROACH.</strong>The purpose of this program is to create opportunities for the poor and marginalised people in the society. <br>
    Our aim is to have an active population that is responsible working towards economic growth and development. We aim at minimizing the poverty levels in the Kenyan society through partnership with various departments. <br>
    Our vision is based on the <strong>UBUNTU SPIRIT</strong> That I am because you Are. I exist because you exist. Our purpose is to foster interpersonall relationship and living for others. In Peace, Love and Unity.
